This repository collects code samples linked from my blog.
Unless otherwise noted, all the code here is in the public domain
(see the LICENSE file in this repository for more details).

I'm making this code available publicly in good faith; note that this does not
mean the code is supported in any way. I'm unlikely to provide significant
support for code in old articles, for example, because sometimes I no longer
have the environment required to run and test the code.
